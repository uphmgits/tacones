You can grant/restrict a member level's access to features, sections of the community. You can also assign levels that have moderation or administrative capabilities.<br /><br />One of your member levels must be marked as the "default level". When new members sign up, they will automatically belong to this level. You can change a specific member's level by editing their account details from the %s page. If you want all members in your community to have the same features and limits, you will only need a single member level (aside from the Super Admin level).";}}";
